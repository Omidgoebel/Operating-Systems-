One of the main functions of an Operating System is file management. The OS creates a file system to effectively organize and store the files and directories. 
This also helps programs by giving them a place to store files and data. Naming, sorting, deleting, moving and copying are some of the actions that the OS needs to  
perform to organize these files. 

The next function of the Operating System is to manage hardware and peripherals. It needs to control all the devices that are connected to the computer in order to 
communicate to them and tell them how to operate. The drivers that you install for your computer help manage these connections with the hardware and peripherals. 

Another function of an Operating System is managing the processor. When you are using a software, the data must be located and loaded into the RAM. 
This allows the CPU to execute the program and the Operating System will manage what the CPU is processing.
